# How to Use

## Command Line Options / Arguments

This script/program supports several argument parameters that can be used. Here's an explanation of the arguments:

`--data` / `-D`: Used when you have a different filename for storing account data. By default, the filename used by this script/program to store account data is `data.txt`. For example, if you have a file named `query.txt` as the file storing account data, just run `bot.py` with the `--data` / `-D` argument. Example: `python bot.py --data query.txt`

`--proxy` / `-P`: Used when you have a different filename for storing the proxy list. The filename used by this script/program to store the proxy list is `proxies.txt`. For example, if you have a file named `prox.txt` as the file storing the proxy list, you just need to add the `--proxy` / `-P` argument parameter to use your proxy file. Example: `python bot.py --proxy prox.txt`

`--worker` / `-W`: This argument is used to customize the number of threads/workers used when the bot script is running. By default, this script/software uses (total CPU cores / 2) as the number of workers. For example, if your CPU has 6 cores, the number of workers used is 3. You can customize the number of workers using this argument. For example, if you want to set the number of workers to 100, run `bot.py` with this argument: `python bot.py --worker 100`. And if you don't like using workers/threads/multiprocessing, you can customize the worker to 1, for example: `python bot.py --worker 1`.

`--action` / `-A`: This argument is used to directly enter the desired menu. For example, if this bot script has 5 menus and you don't want to input manually, you can use this argument to directly enter the desired menu. Example: `python bot.py --action 5` means you will directly enter menu number 5. This argument is useful if you're using docker/pm2 to run the bot script in the background process.

## About Proxies


You can add proxy lists in the `proxies.txt` file, and the proxy format is as follows:

If there is authentication:

Format:

```
protocol://user:password@hostname:port
```

Example:

```
http://admin:admin@69.69.69.69:6969
```

If there is no authentication:

Format:

```
protocol://hostname:port
```

Example:

```
http://69.69.69.69:6969
```

Please pay close attention to whether the proxy you are using requires authentication or not, as many people DM me asking about how to use proxies.
